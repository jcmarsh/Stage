 * This simple client illustrates the use of a plugin interface. It subscribes
 * to a device providing the interface, then tests each message.
 *
 * The important point to note for the purposes of this example is the call to
 * playerc_add_xdr_ftable(). This function adds the XDR serialisation functions
 * to Player's internal table so that messages sent and received by this client
 * can be serialised correctly.
